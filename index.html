                        Hey, there! My name goes by Saksit Wetwitayaklang. I'm a Saint Gabriel's College 
                        graduate and currently a freshman at King Mongkut's University of Technology 
                        Thonburi (KMUTT, for short), majoring in computer engineering in pursuit of 
                        a future career in the circles of cybersecurity (or perhaps artificial 
                        intelligence—I'm still quite ambivalent and vague about my life goals).

                            I figure my personality could be hard to approach sometimes. Many people 
                            tend to find me as a cheerful and phlegmatic individual, and as an introvert, 
                            I'm quite reserved and unsociable, which more or less makes finding new 
                            friends and engaging in a verbal conversation quite challenging. Moreover, 
                            I'm pretty much known among my highschool friends to be exceptionally assiduous 
                            when it comes to anything academic, so it is rather common to see me spending most 
                            of my leisure doing exercises or finishing up the assignments, especially within 
                            the day when they were given.

                             I'd like to make it clear that I am not uncomfortable whatsoever with

                            unless it was compulsory for work or education, and I would only give them 
                            to people I would most likely talk to in person. I'm a pretty private person, 
                            and considering how disingenuous and unscrupulous humans are these days, 
                            especially in cyberspace, I couldn't help but be anxious about my online 
                            privacy and information security. I sincerely hope you understand and respect
